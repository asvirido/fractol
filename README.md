### Description
Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals with minilibX in a project sure to make you 'oouuuahhh'.
```diff

+ Algorithms & AI 
+ Imperative programming 
+ Graphics 
+ Rigor
```
## Subject
```
This project is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what a
fractal is.
```
### The constraints are as follows:
```diff 

+ Your software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals, from which at least
+ the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set (a third fractal is your choice).

+ It must be possible to vary the mouse (without clicking) the parameter of the Julia
+ set. The other types of fractal, it is left to your option.

+ The mouse wheel zooms in and out on the current mouse position, and this in a
+ quasi infinite way (modulo the limits of the machine). This is the same principle of fractals.

+ There must be a minimum play of color to feel the depth of each fractal. Better hack away on psychedelic effects.

+ A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal is to view. If there is no parameter provided,
+ or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays a list of available parameters and exits.
```
### As regards the graphic representation:
```diff

+ You must use the minilibX, in its version for XQuartz installed by default on the
+ dump, or in its native version for MacOS X.

+ You have to manage properly the expose.

+ ESC will exit the program.

+ The use of images of the minilibX is strongly recommended.
```
### Subject - Bonus
```
Here are some interesting ideas to achieve bonus. Of course, you can add bonus of your
invention, which will be assessed by your checkers.
```
```diff
+ In addition to the zoom: displacement with the arrows.

+ Make rotate the colour palette.

+ Full of fun fractals (sites listing more than one hundred different type).

+ 3D representation.

+ For two valid parameters in command line, results two windows of two fractals
